Description: Provides functions on blind source separation over multivariate spatial data, and useful statistics for evaluating performance of estimation on mixing matrix. `BSSoverSpace` uses eigen analysis approach to avoid convergence issue of existing method on large sample data. This package is an implementation of the method described in Zhang, Hao and Yao (2022)<arXiv:2201.02023>.
