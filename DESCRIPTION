Description: Provides functions for blind source separation over multivariate spatial data, and useful statistics for evaluating performance of estimation on mixing matrix. 'BSSoverSpace' is based on an eigen analysis of a positive definite matrix defined in terms of multiple normalized spatial local covariance matrices, and thus can handle moderately high-dimensional random fields. This package is an implementation of the method described in Zhang, Hao and Yao (2022)<arXiv:2201.02023>.
